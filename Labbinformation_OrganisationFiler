Organization of your files

    If the labPM doesn't say differently then (this part is probably where instructions can differ most):

    a) Create a directory in your homedirectory or somewhere else where you like to keep these files. 
    Call it something like pt, algo, labs, ....
    
    b) Move to this directory and create directorys there for each part of the lab called "x.lab1", "x.lab2" and so on 
    where x is your labgroup number 
    from Fire. You put the sourcecode and the README/labreport files in x.laby and when you submit it
    is this directory and it's content that you submit.
    
    So a README file that belongs to lab 1 for the labgroup 53 in the course algorithms will be placed in

    your homedir/algo/53.lab1/README.pdf

    and when you submit i.e. compress with tar, you do so from the directory algo.

    OBS: Make shure these directorys are unreadable to others i.e. that they have permissions set to drwx------. 
    Otherwise your assignement may be copied and then you may be accused of cheating since it's not possible for 
    us to determine who is copying and who is copied from.
