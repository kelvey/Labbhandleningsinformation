    one README.pdf file (sometimes extended to a full labreport) with information about your submission useful for the grader like (preferably in this order)
        your labgroupnumber and your names,
        what files belong to each subproblem,
        what is the compilation/execution commands for each subproblem
        (this is not needed in the case of "javac file.java" but only if compilation command is nonstandard)
        other useful information for the grader,

        and answers to questions and things that are not well contained in the source code (figures, explanations
        of the solutions (if needed), UML diagrams, references etc) and answers to posible questions.
        It also includes reference to all your sources of information that helped you solve the problems, books, 
        magazines, web, alive or dead and so on. The only exception is the coursebook, course slides and irrelevant sources (like your boy/girl-friends continuous support) which you don't need to mention and of course you don't need to mention that you were helped by an assistant on the course.
        Preferably you submit this as a pdf or postscript file. If that's not possible you can hand in handwritten 
        pages on paper directly to the examiner. Be prepared to motivate why you can't make a pdf file. In that case;
        make a README.txt (text file) and say so in your README-file. 

    (compilable) source code (as text files) for every subproblem in separate files.
    Dont forget labgroupnumber and name(s) in every file.

    You must implement programs in the programming language Java and the program has to be compilable (and runable)
    on a StuDat computer see below.

    The correctness of your labs will be partially checked by testing software therefore you must be careful to 
    follow the instructions in each assignment about input/output and placements of code.

    Once more; dont forget labgroupnumber and name(s) in every file.
